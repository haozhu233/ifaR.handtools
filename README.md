# ifaR.handtools
=======
As the biostats group at Institute for Aging Research in HSL, we have developed several functions that we are assembling in this package `ifaR.handtools`. Our goal is to reduce the time and efforts we spent on some common tasks we are facing everyday. 

Some functions in this package are well developped and documented while some are still under development. If you find out a function that you believe could be useful in the future, feel free to add it into this package. We, as a team, can fix the documentation stuff later. 

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email Hao (<haozhu@hsl.harvard.edu>). Please note that this project is currently developed for internal use only. We may consider a public release in the future but for now, please do not use it for external purposes. 

**Please also note that not all of the functions inside this package have been fully tested, please only use them after you read and understand the source code.**
